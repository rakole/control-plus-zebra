# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-23)

**Core value:** Agent Workbench must truthfully classify local coding-agent runs from normalized evidence, not harness-specific assumptions.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Architecture Contracts and Fixture Proof

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Architecture Contracts and Fixture Proof)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Context gathered; ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-23 - Gathered Phase 1 context for architecture contracts and fixture proof

Progress: [----------] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Architecture Contracts and Fixture Proof | 0/4 | 0 | N/A |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: none
- Trend: N/A

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Product name is Agent Workbench.
- Initialization: Gemini CLI is the first adapter, not the product architecture.
- Initialization: Phase 0/1 must prove contracts and fixtures before UI depth.
- Initialization: V1 is read-only and must not launch sessions, control terminals, create PRs, or run arbitrary shell commands.
- Phase 1 context: Use a minimal but future-shaped adapter contract with explicit lifecycle seams and mandatory structured capabilities.
- Phase 1 context: Model the full shared proof nouns now, with deterministic adapter/source/native-based IDs and first-class diagnostics/confidence.
- Phase 1 context: Use one small non-Gemini fake fixture with golden normalized output as the main proof artifact.
- Phase 1 context: Enforce strict import and naming boundaries with both lint and automated tests from the start.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Real Gemini fixture corpus still needs to be gathered during adapter planning.
- Cache backend starts file-backed; revisit SQLite only if realistic fixture volume proves it necessary.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Automation | Session launching, approve/reject, terminal control, PR creation, and branch/worktree cleanup | Deferred to v2+ | Initialization |
| Extensibility | Third-party adapter plugin model and real second non-Gemini adapter | Deferred to v2+ | Initialization |
| Scale | SQLite-backed search/cache and cost estimates | Deferred to v2+ | Initialization |
